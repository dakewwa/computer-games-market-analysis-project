## Description

Project "Analyzing the success of computer games in the online store 'Streamchick'"

As part of this research project, we will analyze historical data on the sales of computer games in the online store "Streamchick". Our goal is to identify patterns that determine the success of games and provide data-driven recommendations for planning advertising campaigns and selecting potentially popular products.

## Conclusion
Based on our analysis, we have drawn the following conclusions:

In North America, Xbox 360, PS2 and Wii were the most popular platforms, and the most popular genres are Action, Sports and Shooter. Here, games with E (Everyone) and M (Mature) ratings have the biggest impact on sales. In Europe, the scenario is slightly different: here PS2, PS3 and Xbox 360 become the top sellers, and Action, Sports and Shooter are also on the list of popular genres. Similar to the North American E and M ratings also have a big impact on sales. In Japan, preferences are different again, with DS, PS and PS2 being the most popular, and the Role-Playing genre topping the preference list. E and K-A ratings are the most sought after in this region. These differences may be due to cultural differences as well as the market and availability of different game platforms. Critics' reviews have a greater impact on game sales than user opinions. ESRB rating also has a significant impact on game sales in different regions. These findings can be used by Streamchick online store to optimize marketing strategies, product mix and overall business planning.
